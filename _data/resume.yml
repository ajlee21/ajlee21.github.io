    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Data Scientist with 12+ years of programming experience and 4+ years of experience in data analytics and visualization.
      Most of my research projects involved analyzing terabytes worth of biomedical text for downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as corpora comparison and text extraction.
      Recently, I have shifted focus onto projects designed to perform bibliometric analyses for government funding clients.
