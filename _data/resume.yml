    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Computational research scientist with 10+ years of experience in data analysis and 4+ years of experience developing and applying maching learning tools.
      Most of my research projects involved analyzing terabytes worth of biomedical text for downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as corpora comparison and text extraction.
      Recently, I have shifted focus onto projects designed to perform bibliometric analyses for government funding clients.
