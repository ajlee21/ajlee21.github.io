David is a 6th year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) in the [Genomics and Computational Biology](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) program. 
During his time in this program, he utilized Deep Learning (recurrent neural networks, feed-forward networks, and transformers) to perform Natural Language Processing techniques (text mining, document classification, recommender systems, and semantic analysis on words). 

Along with his machine learning expertise, he has been programming in various languages such as Java and Python since high school. 
During his undergraduate career, he refined his skill in algorithm development for several computational tasks, such as using SQL to construct and query databases to developing and designing complex data structures. 
As he advances towards the end of his Ph.D. journey, he seeks to become a data scientist to continue to improve and use his analytical skills.
